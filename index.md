## What is Pasalo?
The main goal of Pasalo Project is ease the exchange of digital
contents in an automatic and extremely secure way.

Pasalo focuses on:

*  __Security__: The communication between users must be as secure as possible
*  __Automation__: The transfer and reception of files mustn’t require any intervention
*  __Clasification__: Files are classified. Users subscribed only the content they're interested in


## Why?
Because we wanted a highly secure, scalable and convenient way of
exchanging contents with our buddies. Pasalo has been implemented with
a healthy level of paranoia about security, so it's also specially
interesting if you care about keeping your communications actually private.

## What's Pasalo mean?
Pásalo is the Spanish word for “*pass it along*”.
